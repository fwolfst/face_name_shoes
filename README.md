# Face Name Shoes

In preparation of a physical memory game with pictures of the faces and shoes of our community members, a little vanilla javascript implementation of the same idea.

Learn to identify people as their face, name and shoes.

To adjust, replace the "trairs" array with your names.
Then put JPG images in the same folder following this scheme.
If in your array, you have "michael", place these two files:
"michael_portrait.JPG" and "michael_shoes.JPG" .
